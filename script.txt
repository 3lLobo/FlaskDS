In this video, we'll set up and configure the skeleton of our API. It should be noted that
in a real production application, the structure of your code will likely be different depending
on the size of the application. For the purposes of this tutorial, and to reduce the level of
complexity of the application structure in order to focus on learning the targeted concepts, 
we will write the entirety of our API, with the exception of our data structures, in one dot py file.
If you would like to later extend this API, you can easily reorganize the structure of the application 
by splitting the single dot py file and moving the resulting parts around according to your needs.
